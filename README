Part 2 of my [Movie Hack Day 2012](http://moviehackday.com) project.
An (unofficial) movieclips.com app that lets you search for clips and
watch them right on your phone.

Part 1 is a JSON interface to movieclips.com's XML/Atom API with some
extra sugar, check it out over at github, it's nice and fun and fast:
